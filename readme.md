<h2 id="#about-the-game"> About the game</h2>
You were chilling out when a truck passed dropping some food, that's worth a run. Keep avoiding the obstacles why collecting some delicious things!

Slide up and down and avoid hitting obstacles. Collecting food is going to increase your points.

<h2 id="#game-design"> Game design</h2>
This game's supposed to be hyper-casual, that you enjoy some time while increasing points to use new dogs and discover more about the history. Nothing too complicated, inspired by games like Fishing Food and Like a Dino, and by my own dog.

<h2 id="#game-development"> Game development</h2>
This is a side project created to try something on mobile, and be my first online launch game. I tried in this project to keep my GameStateManager, GameplayManager, and GameSettings as my main files.

GameStateManager is to keep track and control of game states, like Playing, Paused and etc.

GameplayManager is to control things more game-related, like the "speed" of the current session and more things as necessary.

The last one, GameSettings is a Singleton to put all my global variables, to maintain the balance of the game in a  more easy way.

I used Unity as my primary tool, and community assets.
